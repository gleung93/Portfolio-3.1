		"about-body": "The Solar Dashboard is an interactive online experience to help Pacific Gas and Electric’s solar customers track and understand their electricity bill.",
		"role-title": "My role",
		"role-body": "I led the design of this project with oversight from David Royer, Senior UX Designer at Opower. I was responsible for all phases of the design process including; research, wireframing, user testing, visual design and documentation.",

	"intro": {
		"title": "Billing for solar customers works differently.",
		"body1": "Utility bills can be confusing. This is epecially true for Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) customers who own solar panels. Their billing works differently than most because they pay for their electricity usage just once a year instead of every month.",
		"body2": "Our goal was to create a unique online experience for these users to help increase customer satisfaction and reduce call center costs related to bill confusion"

	"current-experience": {
		"sub-heading": "Understanding the current experience",
		"body": "To gain an understanding of the current experience for solar customers I conducted an audit of PGE's webite as well as the  paper statements customers recieve in the mail each month.",
		"img-src": "assets/images/solar/reports.png",
		"conclusion": "I found that there was a large disconnect between the information a user sees online and what they get in the mail."

		"body": "The final deliverable was a specification document that explained the functionality of the product as well as research findings. This was used internally by PG&E to bring stakeholders up to speed so that they could come sign off on the design. It was also used as reference for the developement.",
