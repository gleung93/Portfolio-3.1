		"about-body": "The Opower thermostat app is a way for home owners to control their energy use from anywhere, any time, using their mobile device. My team was tasked with designing a new experience for users to control and set their ideal temperature schedules.",
		"role-title": "My role",
		"role-body": "I worked with a small team of developers and designers on a tight release schedule. Some of my responsibilities included wireframing, user testing, prototyping and Interface animation.",
		"CTA": "Read the Case Study"
	},
	"intro": {
		"title": "More control over home confort.",
		"body1": "A new API for our connected thermostat enabled users to set a more flexible home temperature schedule. This new paradigm required a redesign of two important features of the application.",
		"body2": "With limited developement resources we created a fresh new experience that could be seamlessly integrated into the existing design.",

		"body": "For this project I had to not only create a great user experience but also encourage users to reduce their energy consumption.",
		"img-src": "assets/images/thermostat/away.png",
		"alignment": "padding-top-60",
		"conclusion": "We acheived this by making efficient actions easy and providing users with positive feedback when they are saving energy."
	},
	"limit": {
		"sub-heading": "The sky was not the limit",
		"body": "Instead of designing from the ground up, I had to figure out ways to create a fresh new experience that aligned with the pre-exiting interaction model.",
		"img-src": "assets/images/thermostat/tour.png",
		"alignment": "padding-top-60",
		"conclusion": "Basically, our solution couldnâ€™t break anything that would require additional developement resources."

	"data-driven": {
		"sub-heading": "Data Driven Insights",
		"body": "Analyzing data about how people use the app helped us to discover usuability issues which then led to design insights",

		"img-src": "assets/images/thermostat/data.png"
	},
	"testing": {
		"sub-heading": "Rapid User Testing",
		"body": "For each round of user testing I created two medium fidelity click-through prototypes that could be displayed on mobile devices. I then used a task-based test to discovery any usability issues.",
		"img-src": "assets/images/thermostat/ab.png",
		"conclusion": "By creating two different tests I was able to quickly explore multiple design directions at once."
