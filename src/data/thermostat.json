	"intro": {
		"title": "Billing for solar customers works differently.",
		"body1": "Utility bills can be confusing. This is epecially true for Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) customers who own solar panels. Their billing works differently than most because they pay for their electricity usage just once a year instead of every month.",
		"body2": "Our goal was to create a unique online experience for these users to help increase customer satisfaction and reduce call center costs related to bill confusion"

		"body": "To gain an understanding of the current experience for solar customers I conducted an audit of PGE's webite as well as the  paper statements customers recieve in the mail each month.",
		"img-src": "assets/images/solar/reports.png",
		"conclusion": "I found that there was a large disconnect between the information a user sees online and what they get in the mail."
